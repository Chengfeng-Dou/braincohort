        The Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) is a multi-center cohort study implemented by the National Heart Lung &
        Blood Institute to determine the cardiovascular and other consequences of sleep-disordered breathing. It tests
        whether sleep-related breathing is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, all
        cause mortality, and hypertension.  In all, 6,441 men and women aged 40 years and older were enrolled between
        November 1, 1995 and January 31, 1998 to take part in SHHS Visit 1. During exam cycle 3 (January 2001- June
        2003), a second polysomnogram (SHHS Visit 2) was obtained in 3,295 of the participants. CVD Outcomes data were
        monitored and adjudicated by parent cohorts between baseline and 2011. More than 130 manuscripts have
        been published investigating predictors and outcomes of sleep disorders. Click here for a full description of
        SHHS. Read more about SHHS at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00005275).
